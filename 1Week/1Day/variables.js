//this is making a variable in js
var name = 'Nikoloi'
//NEVER EVER USE VAR AGAIN
console.log(name)
// let and const were a part of es6
// they function almost the same as var, but the have better variable scoping
// what does that mean? you'll see in the next demo
let name2 = 'Ramel'
console.log(name2)
//const is like let, but const cannot be reassigned after it was declared
const name3 = 'Alec'
console.log(name3);

//this throws an error we cannot reassign a constant variable
//name3 = 'something else'
